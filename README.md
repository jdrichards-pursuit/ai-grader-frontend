# GitHub PR Code Analyzer

This is a frontend for the PR Request Grader. It is built with React and Vite on the frontend and Express on the backend.

The app allows you to choose between analyzing a complete repo PR or a single file within a repo PR.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Git installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd github-pr-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN= # Github Personal Access Token
CLAUDE_API_KEY= # Claude API Key
```

## GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be a Personal Access Token. To generate one:

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click your profile picture in the top right
3. Go to Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)
4. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Give your token a name in the "Note" field (e.g., "PR Code Analyzer")
6. Set expiration as needed (e.g., 30 days)
7. Select scopes:
   - Check `repo` for full repository access
   - This includes access to PRs, code, and repository contents
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!
10. Paste the token after `GITHUB_TOKEN=` in your `.env` file

⚠️ Security Notes:
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- If you accidentally expose your token, delete it immediately in GitHub and generate a new one
- Keep your tokens secure - they provide access to your GitHub account
